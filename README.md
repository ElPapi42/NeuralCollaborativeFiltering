# Recommendation System
### Using Matrix Factorization and Neural Collaborative Filtering

During this experiment we will be testing Matrix Factorization and Neural Collaborative Filtering for recommendation engines, using Movie Lens 20 Millions Dataset

During Experiments, the best results where obtained by "flowing-sky-49": https://app.wandb.ai/elpapi42/recommendation-system/runs/jlh52uym?workspace=user-elpapi42. Features ultra low variance between datasets.
